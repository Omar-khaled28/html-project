                    <li>ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device.</li>

                    <li>transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money.</li>
                    <li>automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention.</li>

                </td>

               <td><h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.</li>
            
            <li> Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging</li>
            <li> If there's a bug in the system, it's likely that every connected device will become corrupted.</li>
            <li> Since there's no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it's difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</li>
